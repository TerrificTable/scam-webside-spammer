# scam-webside-spammer
just a program i made cuz a friend got tokenlogged and spammed me with these scam/phishing links so i made a programm to spam these websides with fake logins
I made it in python and compiled it to an exe file (both of these can be downloaded)

# Installation
i did not make a requirements list or a bat file to do that at the moment mby im gona do that later
so you have to install all requirements your self (idk if the exe work without the requirements installed)
```
python -m pip install requests
python -m pip install colorama
```
oh yea before that you should eighter download the [release](https://github.com/TerrificTable/scam-webside-spammer/releases) or git clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/TerrificTable/scam-webside-spammer
cd scam-webside-spammer
```
and then install the requirements
if you have done that you can eighter run the py file and edit it however you like or you can use the .exe file i compiled both of these are the same code if you didnt change the .py file    
or...    
run the run.bat file and select the option you want to use (or run the individual run_py/run_exe files) !!! IMPORTANT: the exe/py and bat files have to be in the same folder !!!

# What does it do
it uses requests to spamm the given url with random generated logins (email and password)   
you can set to custom arguments (max 2) to send the password and emails to
