# scam-webside-spammer
just a program i made cuz a friend got tokenlogged and spammed me with these scam/phishing links so i made a programm to spam these websides with fake logins
I made it in python and compiled it to an exe file (both of these can be downloaded)

# Installation
i did not make a requirements list or a bat file to do that at the moment mby im gona do that later
so you have to install all requirements your self (idk if the exe work without the requirements installed)
```
python -m pip install requests
python -m pip install colorama
```
and if you have done that you can eighter run the py file and edit it however you like or you can use the .exe file i compiled both of these are the same code if you didnt change the .py file

# What does it do
it uses requests to spamm the given url with random generated logins (email and password)   
you can set to custom arguments (max 2) to send the password and emails to

# Disclamer
Im not responsible for any damage coused by this tool
